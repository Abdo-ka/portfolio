### About

Property Management System for [Hotel Sentral Group](https://hotelsentral.com.my/) that facilitates hotel operations and guest experience.

The PMS manages room bookings, guest check-ins/outs, folios for charges and payments, and integrates with online travel agencies (OTA) to automate reservations. It also provides financial reporting and occupancy insights.

I actively contributed to the development of the PMS, and maintained it after going live through bug fixes and implementing new feature requests.
