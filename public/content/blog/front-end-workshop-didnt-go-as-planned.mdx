Last month, I was invited to do a one-week workshop about front-end development at Aleppo University. In this article, I'll be sharing my experiences and thoughts from standing in front of a classroom as the instructor for the first time.

### Back to university, this time as the instructor

Now, a little context about this workshop, many computer science students in Syria begin their studies with limited knowledge of the field and its various career paths (development, AI, networking, etc.). To address this, the university annually organizes workshops led by industry volunteers who introduce students to different domains, helping them explore potential career specializations.

I was invited to lead the front-end workshop. And as the material was up to me, I faced my first dilemma: what should I teach? One of the previous workshops covered web fundamentals (HTML + CSS + JS), but I thought that might be boring and wouldn't really give a good picture of today's front-end world. So, I thought React would be more engaging. However, one week is too long to only talk about general concepts (how the web works, front-end vs. back-end...) and too short to really go into technical concepts. This is because, despite being called a workshop, it's really just a 1-2 hour lessons given in a classroom. What was even more challenging was that the audience had very different programming backgrounds, some didn't even know what a programming language even was! so, after a lot of considerable thoughts, I settled on the following titles for each session:

1. Web Fundamentals (HTML + CSS + JS)
2. Intro to React
3. State Management & Event Handling
4. Data Fetching - Doing API calls
5. An Example: To Do List
6. Roadmap: How to become a front-end developer.

The first session's attendance was great, around 100, but as the session progressed, I started to notice that some students got bored, and some couldn't keep up with what was presented (which made sense, as HTML, CSS, and JS each need a course on their own). But I tried to keep them motivated by saying that it was okay if they didn't understand everything, as the purpose of this workshop was to introduce them to front-end development and that we would see a real-world full example later.

The second session's attendance dropped to less than 25 attendees! which I expected, but it still felt disheartening. It continued like this until the fifth session (An Example: To Do List), with less than 10 attendees! (Although the last session's attendance was much higher because the topic was general.) Now, more than a couple of weeks after the end of this workshop, I had some reflections and lessons, and I'll try to share them here.

### Know your audience

This seems pretty obvious, and I actually had this information before the workshop started, as we did a survey and had some clues from previous workshops. What I got wrong was not acting upon this information and proceeding to talk about React, which was pretty advanced as it required web fundamentals knowledge. The idea I had in mind when deciding on the workshop material was that the intended audience for this workshop should be ready to be introduced to advanced concepts, even if the audience was small. But after seeing all the students on the first day and how they were overwhelmed with a lot of technical stuff and may have even felt intimidated, I think I should have curated the workshop to fit them instead of forcing the audience to fit my workshop. You might argue with this logic, but in this instance, I feel I should have matched the expectations of the motivated new students instead of potentially discouraging them.

### Writing courses should be like writing TV shows

This probably only applies to courses intended for beginners, but like a good TV show, you need to have a good [premise](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-a-premise-of-a-story-definition/)--the first episode need to make the audience interested enough to watch the whole series, or come for the next session in our case. I think I did very badly in this regard when I dived into web languages right after giving a brief introduction about how the web works and front-end concepts, which was probably boring. Not because HTML, CSS, and JS were boring in themselves (you probably shouldn't get into front-end if you find all of them boring anyway), but because we find anything boring if we don't understand it and engage with it, which was probably the case for most of the audience. This made them believe that the remaining sessions would follow the same pattern (bad premise) and in response, they decided they wouldn't benefit from attending again, which is exactly what happened.

So, what I think I should have done is try to make the first session as interesting and exciting as possible and not take it for granted that people will be patient enough to continue with me, basically making a good first impression. So, back to the workshop, the first session should avoid showing any code or any technical concepts and focus instead on giving a broad introduction about front-end development, what the day-to-day work is like, and what the role entails, and so on.

I should probably have shown examples of what you can possibly do as a front-end developer and the exciting idea of building whatever you envision, etc. I expect this would be more interesting to a total beginner and may even be suitable for someone who knows basic programming and web fundamentals but doesn't know the potentials of this career. The funny thing is that the content for the last session (Roadmap: How to become a front-end developer) was more or less like that. My idea was to reward them after the hard and boring programming details with what makes this domain interesting and fun. But instead, the first impression was bad, and 75% of the audience didn't stick around to see that.

### Workshop length: keeping the goal in sight

I mentioned that the workshop was for one week (plus one extra day from the next week, so six days), but this actually wasn't a requirement. It was just what previous workshops had done before and what the other workshops were planning to do too. So, in my attempt to fill those sessions, I needed to cut back on some topics and go into detail for others, which obviously made the sessions inconsistent and forced me to talk about concepts the audience weren't ready for. Looking back, one or two sessions (3 hours or so) would have been enough to achieve the goal of the workshop, which is introducing front-end development and encouraging the students to start learning it. This would have been way more fun and engaging. Even though this would have been very different from the type and size of content that other workshops presented, it would have achieved the goal better.

### Final Thoughts

The takeaways from this article are probably too niche for most people to actually apply anywhere, it's just something I thought I should write down somewhere. This experience was pretty unique for me. I was always in the student seat, and standing on the podium allowed me to notice things I never did before. For example, I never thought of this, but the instructor can really notice how engaged or bored the audience is, if they're understanding what is being presented or not, and the overall feeling of the audience. This made me feel for professors who have to teach boring and hard courses and see students dying from boredom ðŸ˜…

I also hadn't considered teaching before, as I'm not very good at explaining things (according to my friends from university), and I'm mostly an introvert too. So, when I was invited to do this, I thought it was a good opportunity to try it out. Now, after completing this workshop, I think it was a very fulfilling experience, a different kind of fulfillment that comes from doing development work. So, I'm definitely open to doing this again in the future, and maybe I wouldn't be as bad next time.
