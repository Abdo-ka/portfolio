The following is a list of resources that I use to stay up to date with software development.

## Newsletters

I like newsletters because I can check them on my pace whenever I can. You should use a newsletter app to manage them though,
as they will clutter your email inbox otherwise. I personally use [mailbrew](https://mailbrew.com/).

1. [TLDR - A Byte Sized Daily Tech Newsletter](https://tldr.tech)
1. [Bytes - Your weekly dose of JS](https://bytes.dev)
1. [This Week in React](https://thisweekinreact.com/)
1. [React Digest](https://reactdigest.net/)
1. [Josh Comeau](https://joshwcomeau.com/)
1. [Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/)

I had subscribed to more before, but I think limiting the list to what gives your real value is better than getting overwhelmed with a lot of emails (that you won't read anyway),
so try to build your own list.

## Social Media

This is actually what helps me the most in keeping up to date.
As I check social media apps almost daily even if it's only for few minutes.

X and Bluesky are really great to learn about new tools and libraries.
Also almost all libraries (or library authors) have accounts there, so follow them there to get updates about new releases and features.

### Bluesky

I recently started using Bluesky, cause X/Twitter is not what it used to be. you should give it a try too.

### LinkedIn

Just don't.

## Podcasts

I tried out a couple of podcasts, didn't really like them, too much talking, not much value (which I don't mind for certain topics, just not for tech).
But I do find [Syntax.fm](https://syntax.fm) to be decent.
