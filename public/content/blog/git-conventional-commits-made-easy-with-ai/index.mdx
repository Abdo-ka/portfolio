Stick to following Conventional Commits by leveraging AI. This guide shows how to setup for VS Code and how to share the configuration across the team.

## The Problem

You probably used AI commit generation feature in Copilot or Cursor or any other AI assistant:

<Image
  src="image.png"
  alt="AI commit in Cursor"
  linkClassName="max-w-md mx-auto aspect-[8]"
/>

and it works fine, in fact, it makes it a lot easier to keep your commits descriptive and not just go with `fix typo`,
particularly if you like to follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/),
if you're not familiar with them, a conventional commit is something like:

```txt
fix(posts): prevent racing of requests

- Introduce a request id and a reference to latest request. Dismiss
incoming responses other than from latest request.
- Remove timeouts which were used to mitigate the racing issue but are
obsolete now.
```

And as you would expect, it's hard to stick to this format, especially when working in a team.
But now with all those AI assistants, following conventional commits shouldn't be as cumbersome.

## Solution

There are two main requirements:

- The ability to provide custom prompt to tailor the commit message.
- Should be possible to easily use this tool across the team.

I've been using [AI Commit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Sitoi.ai-commit) VS Code extension for a while now and it does the job for me,
You need to provide it an API key (OpenAI, Gemini) and a prompt to be used to generate the message.

For the API key,
at the time of writing, Gemini 2.5 pro is great, you can generate an API key for free here [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey),

For the prompt, I've been using this:

```txt
type(scope): A helpful concise summary of changes (imperative mood, lowercase, no period at end)
- Thorough explanation of point one
- Thorough explanation of point two
- (up to two more points if needed)

Rules:
- 'type' must be one of: feat, fix, refactor.
- 'scope' indicates the feature/area affected (e.g., user, cart, api). Separate multiple scopes with a comma (e.g., user,auth).
- The summary should be concise and describe the change as an instruction (e.g., 'add login button', not 'added login button').
- The body should contain 1 to 4 bullet points explaining the 'what' and 'why'.
- respond with plain text only, no code blocks
- Ensure the total commit message length does not exceed 500 characters.
- Separate the subject line from the body with a single blank line.
```

To easily share this setup with the team, assuming all your team members use VS Code,
or any VS Code fork, you can add the following to your workspace's `.vscode/extensions.json` file:

```json
{
  "recommendations": ["sitoi.ai-commit"]
}
```

and configure the extension's prompt and model in `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "ai-commit.AI_PROVIDER": "gemini",
  "ai-commit.GEMINI_MODEL": "gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25",
  "ai-commit.AI_COMMIT_SYSTEM_PROMPT": "type(scope): A helpful concise summary of changes (imperative mood, lowercase, no period at end)\n\n- Thorough explanation of point one\n- Thorough explanation of point two\n- (up to two more points if needed)\n\nRules:\n- 'type' must be one of: feat, fix, refactor.\n- 'scope' indicates the feature/area affected (e.g., user, cart, api). Separate multiple scopes with a comma (e.g., user,auth).\n- The summary should be concise and describe the change as an instruction (e.g., 'add login button', not 'added login button').\n- The body should contain 1 to 4 bullet points explaining the 'what' and 'why'.\n- respond with plain text only, no code blocks\n- Ensure the total commit message length does not exceed 500 characters.\n- Separate the subject line from the body with a single blank line."
}
```

Now, when a team member opens the workspace in VS Code, they will be prompted to install the recommended extension.

They will still need to add their personal API key. The user `settings.json` file is appropriate for that:

```json
{
  // your other user settings,
  "ai-commit.GEMINI_API_KEY": "**********"
}
```

And that's about it, this way all team members can commit with conventional messages consistently,
if you use a different editor you should be able to find a similar plugin/extension for this as the functionality is quite simple.

Sometimes though the generated commit message is not really accurate and doesn't highlight what's the commit about due to lack of context,
but I still think the generated message is a good start anyway.
